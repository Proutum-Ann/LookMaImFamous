                            <p>Edgar Allan Poe was known as an American writer, editor, literary critic, and most famously of all, a poet. He's often well regarded in modern times, despite the hiccups he's had in life, and is remembered today as a revolutionary poet. He led a famous yet sad life, in gambling, addiction, and depression, dying at the ripe age of 40 years old.</p>

                    <p>Edgar Allan Poe, son of famous actors, and orphaned at three. He would go on to being raised by a prosperous Virginian exporter by the name of John Allan. He'd lived a rather educated childhood, but that would end once he started college in the University of Virginia, where he had to drop out due to insufficient funding from Allan and generally not being financially stable. </p>
                    <p>Edgar Allan Poe would later move to Boston and pursue a military career, in which he would be honorably discharged as a regimental sergeant major after publishing his first poetry collection, <i>Tamerlane, and Other Poems.</i>. He was later sent to complete his education and admitted to the United States Military Academy at West Point. He would run into a financial roadblock again, however, as Allan refused to pay for the school and did not give consent for Allan Poe to go to the academy. He was later dismissed due to ignoring his duties and violating regulations at the academy</p>
                    <p>He would leave for New York city, publishing a few more poems before settling down for a few years with his aunt, Mrs. Maria Clemm, in Baltimore. After quite a bit of moving, Allan Poe would finally settle in the state of New York.</p>

                    <p>Edgar Allan Poe is regarded as the inventor of the modern detective story and horror genre and widely regarded for how his stories had crossed the Atlantic, introducing Europeans to modern American literature. Readers were fascinated by Poe's depiction and interpretation of the human mind, and he himself likely wrote from experience.</p>
  <!-- Contributions -->
                  <h3>Contributions to Society</h3>
                  <p>Besides his stories introducing new genre of detective stories to America, he was able to sway the public's perception of horror stories. More people enjoyed horror works as well, and became interested in writing their own.</p>
                  <p>The modern short story structure was also all thanks to Edgar Allan Poe's literature.</p>

                    <p>Allan Poe and the Allans' relationship very quickly deteriorated after he had to drop out of college due to insufficient fund from his foster father along with gambling debt.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">Financial Instability</h3>
                    <p>Edgar Allan Poe was largely financially unstable for most of his life, even if his foster father had quite a bit of money. Due to this, he was never able to fully complete his college education, and was unable to fund and maintain his position as a cadet in the military academy.</p>
                    <p>He also largely suffered from gambling debt, which was likely the reason why he was struggling financially during college in the first place.</p>

                    <p>Despite his success as a writer, it can be assumed that his home life was not very great, as not only had he abused substances, but also had underlying mental issues that were undiagnosed.</p>
